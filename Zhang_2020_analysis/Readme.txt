This the matlab code of the three key models in our paper, Multi-T-EIS-Capacity GPR, Multi-T-EIS-RUL GPR and ARD-GRP.


##Description:

The code are divided into three matlab scripts (named as Multi_T_EIS_Capacity_GPR.m, Multi_T_EIS_RUL_GPR.m and ARD_GPR.m) to test the model in the script name separately.

The scripts test the models to reproduce the correpsonding result on the 35C02 cell.
The original results in the main manuscript are shown in Fig. 3(a), Fig. 4(b) and Fig.3 (c), respectively.
Each of these script consists of four parts: data preprocessing, model training, testing and result visualization. Please refer to the comments in each script for more details.

##Execution:

Right clicking on the script and clicking on "run", or typing the name of the script in the "Command Window" and hitting the "enter" key.

##Dependencies:

Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (GPML) toolbox is in "gpml-matlab-v4.2-2018-06-11" file.
The relevant data used by each model is saved in *.txt files.
